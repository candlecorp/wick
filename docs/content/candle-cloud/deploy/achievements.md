# Unlocking Achievements on Candle Cloud

At Candle Cloud, we believe in rewarding our users' dedication and commitment. Achievements are a fun and exciting way for you to opt-in to higher tiers of entitlements, granting you additional resources and capabilities for your Wick applications.

## Accessing Achievements:

1. **Navigating to Entitlements**:

   - Click on your username located in the top right corner of the dashboard.
   - Select `Entitlements` from the dropdown menu.

2. **Viewing Achievements**:
   - Within the `Entitlements` section, you'll find a dedicated area that lists available achievements.
   - Each achievement is paired with its specific reward, giving you clear insight into what you can unlock.

## Claiming Rewards:

Once you've completed the requirements for an achievement, the associated rewards will be credited to your account. However, keep in mind:

- It can take **up to 1 hour** for the system to recognize and register a completed achievement. We appreciate your patience during this period.
- Ensure you've met all the requirements of the achievement. Each achievement's criteria must be fully met before rewards are granted.
